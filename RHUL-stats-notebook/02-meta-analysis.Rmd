# Meta-analyses {#meta-analysis}

For running meta-analyses, we recommend checking the `metafor` package for R ([link 1](https://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php), [link 2](https://wviechtb.github.io/metafor/)).

A comprehensive, hands-on guide on how to use this package is freely available in the book by Harrer and colleagues [@harrer2021doing], freely available at this [link](https://bookdown.org/MathiasHarrer/Doing_Meta_Analysis_in_R/).


An alternative to the `metafor` package is to Bayesian multilevel modelling. This is also discussed in [@harrer2021doing]. A more technical discussion of Bayesian multilevel modelling for meta-analyes is provided in [this paper](https://psyarxiv.com/7tbrm/) [@williams_rast_b√ºrkner_2018].
